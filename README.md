# Expo Constants.deviceId Returns Null in Background Tasks

This repository demonstrates a bug where `Constants.deviceId` returns `null` when accessed within a background task in an Expo managed workflow app.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and app crashes.

## Bug Description

When the app is running in the background and attempts to access `Constants.deviceId`, the value may be `null` instead of the expected device ID.  This inconsistency breaks functionality relying on a persistent device identifier.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on a physical device or emulator.
4. Send the app to the background.
5. Observe the console logs - `Constants.deviceId` may output `null` within the background task.

## Solution

The solution involves handling the potential `null` value gracefully and ensuring reliable identification even in background tasks.  This might involve using an alternative persistent identifier or handling the missing ID with error states.
